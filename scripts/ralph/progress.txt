# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-12

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for className merging
- Use Icons from `@/components/g3/Icons`
- API responses: `{ success: boolean, data?, error?, field?, message? }`
- Zod schemas in `src/lib/api/validation.ts`
- Dashboard components in `src/components/dashboard/`
- G3 Engine components in `src/components/g3/`
- Use `class-variance-authority` for UI variants
- Use `forwardRef` pattern for components
- Use `wouter` for routing (NOT react-router-dom)
- Run `pnpm run check` before commits

## 2026-01-12 - MCP-004
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bb483-2a2f-74bf-b4b7-33cb01868e61
- Verified all MCP tasks (MCP-001, MCP-002, MCP-003, MCP-004) were already implemented
- Agent tools already registered in `server/mcp/index.ts`
- todo.md already marked "Implement full MCP protocol support" as complete
- README.md already has comprehensive agent/memory tools documentation
- Updated PRD to mark MCP-004 as completed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - All MCP protocol features were already implemented prior to this PRD
  - Check existing code thoroughly before implementing - may already be done
  - The server/mcp/tools/agent.ts has 6 tools (agent/execute, agent/status, memory/store, memory/retrieve, memory/list, memory/delete)
