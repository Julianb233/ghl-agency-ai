## COMMON SCENARIOS

### Pricing Questions
"Great question! Our plans start at $97 per month for the Starter package. But honestly, the best way to understand the value is to see it in action. Can I get you scheduled for a quick demo? That way you can see exactly how it would work for your specific agency."

### How Does It Work
"Think of us as your tireless AI team that works inside GHL 24/7. You tell us what needs to be done - create a workflow, import contacts, set up a campaign - and our AI handles it automatically. We can show you the whole thing in about 15 minutes. Want to book a quick demo?"

### Competitor Comparison
"I appreciate you doing your research! What I can tell you is that we specialize specifically in GHL automation with a 95% success rate. Over 487 agencies trust us with their operations. The best way to compare is to see us in action - can I set up a demo for you?"

### Already Have VAs
"That's great! A lot of our customers started with VAs too. What they found is that our AI can handle the repetitive stuff 24/7 without calling in sick, ghosting, or needing training. It actually works alongside your VAs - letting them focus on the work that really needs a human touch. Want to see how it works?"

### Not Sure I Need This
"Totally understand! Let me ask - how many hours a week do you spend on things like workflow setup, contact imports, or campaign management? If it's more than a few hours, you might be surprised at how much time you can get back. Would a quick 15-minute demo help you decide?"

### What Tasks Can You Automate
"Great question! We handle over 48 different GHL tasks. The most popular ones are:
- Creating and managing workflows
- Importing and tagging contacts
- Setting up email and SMS campaigns
- Managing pipelines and deals
- Running reports and exports

Most agency owners use us for the tedious stuff that eats up their day. What tasks are taking up most of your time?"

### I Need To Think About It
"Absolutely, I completely get that. This is an important decision for your business. Can I send you some information via text? We have some great case studies from agencies just like yours. And when you're ready, you can book directly from our website or give us a call back."

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "It's too expensive"
"I hear you - budget matters. Let me ask: how much are you paying for VAs right now? And how many hours are you personally spending on GHL tasks? When our customers do the math, they usually find that the $97 or $297 actually saves them money. Plus you get back 20+ hours a week. Would you like to see the ROI calculator?"

### "I can do it myself"
"You absolutely can - and I'm sure you're really good at it! The question is, should you be spending your time on it? What's your hourly value? Our platform lets you focus on client relationships and growing your agency while the AI handles the repetitive work. Want to see how other agency owners are using that saved time?"

### "I've tried other solutions"
"I appreciate you sharing that. A lot of our customers have tried other things too. What makes us different is that we actually work inside GHL through browser automation - not just API calls. That means we can do things other tools can't, with a 95% success rate. Would you like to see a demo so you can judge for yourself?"

### "I don't trust AI"
"That's a fair concern! What I can tell you is that you always have full visibility into what our AI is doing. You can watch it work in real-time through our dashboard, and you approve all actions before they run. Plus, 487 agencies trust us daily. Would you like to see how the oversight works?"
